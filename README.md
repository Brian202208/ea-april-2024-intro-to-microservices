# Introduction to Microservices

The goal of this assignment is to cover the basics of microservices, their benefits and challenges, popular tools, and case studies of their implementation.

###  Introduction
---
* Define microservices architecture: An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, which implement business capabilities.
* Briefly compare with monolithic architecture to highlight the context and evolution.

###  Principles of Microservices
- - -
* Decentralization: Services are developed, deployed, and managed independently.
* Componentization: Services are treated as independent components that can be easily replaced and upgraded.
* Autonomy: Teams work independently on each service, reducing the coordination overhead.
* Technology Diversity: Teams can choose the best tool for their specific needs, fostering innovation.

### Advantages of Microservices
- - - 
* Scalability: Services can be scaled independently, allowing for more efficient use of resources.
* Resilience: Faults in one service do not impact others, improving overall system robustness.
* Technological Agility: Allows the adoption of new technologies and processes without overhauling the entire system.

###  Challenges of Microservices
- - -
* Complexity: Increased operational and management complexity.
* Data Integrity: Ensuring data consistency across services can be challenging.
* Network Issues: Dependency on network latency and load balancing.
* Skill Set: Requires a broad set of skills from development teams, including DevOps capabilities.

### Submission
- - -
* Summarize the key points made.
* Submit the report in Word format.

### Important Notes
---

 * You are not allowed to share codes with your classmates. If detected, you will get NC.
 * **For pairs:**
	 * Individual's work will be checked from the commits.
	 *  Share tasks evenly and fairly.
	 *  To have a clearer understanding of pair programming:
		 *  > **Pair programming** is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the _driver_, writes code while the other, the _observer_ or _navigator_ reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

-   Remember to respect the code honor submission policy. All written code must be original. Presenting something as oneâ€™s own work when it came from another source is plagiarism and is forbidden.
    
-   Plagiarism is a very serious thing in all American academic institutions and is guarded against vigilantly by every professor.
